Fixing habits one filler at a time
For the Amazon Echo public speaking helper, we used a software program called flask-ask, which is a python API to interact with the amazon echo device. We used this to write the different skills with Alexa. For the amazon echo, you first give your speech in the beginning, and then activate our program by saying “start speech monitor”, and then Alexa will prompt you to be more specific with what you need help with. Then, it will promptly say the statistics of how many filler/swear words you said.
